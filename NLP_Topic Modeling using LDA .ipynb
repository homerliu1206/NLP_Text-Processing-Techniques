      "Document about 'waiting time' in star 1 reviews: [\"They have the worst customer service skills imaginable. Do not go there if you want a quick pizza and don't call in because they won't even keep your order. I waited for over 30 minutes after I called in an order and they told me it wasn't ready yet then it wasn't in the system. Please save your time and money go to a different one becase the people who work here don't deserve it.\", 'The staff was extremely rude here. The wait staff at the snack bar did not greet us or say anything to us at all. She rolled her eyes and sighed when I requested napkins and silverware. The manager was also rude almost refusing to put up the guards for an 11 year old because it\\'s only for \"under 10\". He was condescending and rude as well. When talking to him about the experience and how it was ruined but the terrible customer service he responded insincerely and sarcastically. I have been to many bowling alleys in Tucson and this is my first time ever having an experience this bad. The place was great but won\\'t be returning due to the staff.', 'My lord... where do I begin? The name of the company says it all. Wing. STOP. Terrible and more so lacking flavours paired with reheated and rubbery wings. Do yourself a favour and cook your own you lazy bastard.  Same wait time, 1/3 the price.', \"After picking up from here for delivery several times i decided to come here for myself. Placed our order of 20 traditional wings with Pineapple Jalapeno and Mango Habanero sauce. After waiting for quite awhile and noticing customers who came after us receive their order, my gf hypothesized that the staff was afraid to try to pronounce my name. I didn't believe it until the staff looked at me several times then pointed to me and performed non-verbal hand/arm motions for me to pick up my food, whereas everyone else's names were called out loud and clear. I found this humorous and mildly disrespectful, it is actually not why im reviewing this place poorly. I requested blue cheese and whatever i got was labeled blue cheese but was far departed from it. My girlfriend was convinced it was spoiled ranch. My wings were somewhat crispy but my girlfriend's wings were slimy and the skin just slid off each wing which was unacceptable. I dont know why they didnt drop our order at the same time, i dont know what i received instead of blue cheese, and we definitely wont be coming back.\", 'The bathrooms were closed for over half an hour which means that none of the customers were able to wash their hands. This is a problem during the corona outbreak. We ordered ribs, and when the ribs came in they were completely raw. Even the waitress said \"disgusting. \" They never cleared our tables. We were never offered a refill on our drinks. Their  complementary Onions, peppers, Guacamole, And cucumbers are never stocked. For almost $70 that it cost us to eat I\\'m disappointed at the terrible service. We did complain, and the only response was \"we hope you give us a second chance.\"', \"If I could give 0 Stars I would we were told 40 min wait and we waited 1 hour n 40min we even called after n hour were told 10 more min people that got there after me and my lady were being seated before us and we called again and were told we were next and they didn't seat us so we chose to leave will not be going back to this place they close at 3 pm and we waited till 2:30pm we got there at around 12:10.\", \"Nope, not again. I always give a place 2-3, this is my 2nd stop.... And my last.  Both times I've been here for breakfast, and I'll give it to' em, they're cooks know what they're doing, but man! The service just sucks, sucked first time, sucks this time. They seat you fast but then you wait, this time was 11 min before someone stopped by and asked what we want to drink. THEN, waited on people that were seated AFTER we were. Eh, that's just my pet peeve. Waitress never made it by to check on our meal and brought my drink after I was done with my meal. Oh well.... On to the next place\", 'Went to get lunch for myself and my kids at about 11:05 am. Decided to go in and order so I wouldn\\'t hold up the drive thru.  Standing there for about 5 minutes with no other customer in front of me, no acknowledgement from any employee, even had 1 employee walk past me without saying a word. Got frustrated so decided to go to the drive thru. Again, no car in front of me, or next to me (it\\'s a double lane drive thru). I was told \"I\\'ll be right with you.\". Okay.  About a minute or two after waiting, a vehicle pulled up to the other terminal. Their order taken right away, and they pulled forward. I was shocked. I continued to wait another minute before finally being asked if I had been helped. I said nope and reversed my car and left. They didn\\'t want my money, So i went to a competitor where I wasn\\'t ignored. I live near this McDonald\\'s, but I will gladly go to the competitor from now on.', \"Let me start by saying we have been to the Firetruck Brewing on the other side of town.  It was amazing!   Then we noticed this Firetruck Brewing closer to home and were excited.  We loved Growlers and this is the same location.   Sadly, this place was WAY understaffed for a Saturday afternoon, so service was super slow.   I don't blame the servers for this, it's not there fault.  They were hustling.  I blame the management for understaffing.   Every time I have been to this location, whether it was Growlers, or Firetruck, Saturday's are busy.  Staff accordingly!      The food at this location was terrible.  The food at the Grant location was amazing.   I ordered a sandwich and asked the waitress to use sourdough rather that rye and she didn't even bother to write this down.  When the food arrived 1 hours later...it was wrong.  The loaded Mac and cheese was a flavorless pile of mushy pasta.    This is bar food. This should be easy to get right.  The Grant locations food is so flavorful, but the people in this kitchen obviously could care less.  I am guessing by the way the front of the house is staffed, the back of the house is no better.   Please fix this and you will have a successful restaurant!\", \"3rd time trying this place, took half an hour to get drinks. Told waitress my kids wanted to order food, she said she'd be right back. 20 mins later, I asked her again, she started taking my daughters order,  another waitress interrupted and they both left. We waited another 20 mins and walked out. Always understaffed for busy nights.\", 'If I could leave zero stars I would. The customer service at this establishment is ridiculous. The employees were so rude except for the little white old lady. There were no customers in there and I placed an online order. The people in the back were complaining because they had a catering and they told us to come back later. When we came back they said \"why did they come back?\".  I had to wait 40 minutes plus 20 minutes without being greeted. This is ridiculous! I will never be visiting this place again!', 'Worst McDonalds in Tucson. Too bad, it\\'s the closest one to my house. Usually, I pass it and go to another one, but today I thought against my better judgement, \"Maybe this time it\\'ll be different\". It wasn\\'t. Still had to pull forward in the drive thru...standard. Even after waiting 5 additional minutes for my food, the fries were old, stale, and cold...standard. Not a single napkin...at the drive thru...standard. Why do I torture myself like this?! Should\\'ve just gone to the other one down the street...standard. I know, I know, \"It\\'s McDonalds, what do you expect?\" I\\'ve been to a hundred different McDonalds, and even with the \"McDonalds factor\" taken into account, this is hands down THE WORST restaurant/fast food chain I have ever been to. If you need your McDonalds fix, go to another one...the one down the street on Swan and Camp Lowell is much better.', \"Went here hoping for a good meal but was left disappointed. The food served to my husband and I was nothing but the cheapest products you can find used to make their dishes. The food was bland, no flavor, and the waitress was unfriendly and slow. Will never come back or recommend to a single soul. They will definitely serve you microwaveable sausage and be unapologetic when you're unhappy by their terrible food.\", \"Cold food, even when they send you to wait, when they brought out our food 5 minutes later all was cold.  Also, I've gotten food poisoning a few times here.  Just...don't.\", \"Placed an order on 4/27 for a medium Howies Special pizza, a small gluten free Works pizza minus black olives, Asian Howie wings and Buffalo Howie wings.\\n\\nNot a complicated order, was made online; estimated time was 40 minutes. As we approached the two hour mark I tried calling the store. Sat waiting for 15 minutes waiting for someone to pick up before I gave up. Tried calling again five minutes later, same thing. My son tried and got the same thing. No one was answering at the store.\\n\\nAt two hours and twenty five minutes a delivery driver shows up with the food. I am not mean, I do not yell and I do not curse. I simply ask him why it took so long to get the food to us. He gives a sad excuse that really does not answer my question and says I need to call the store. I told him I would but no one is answering the phones at the store. He says something about this is why he isn't a manager anymore and beats a hasty retreat before I can ask or say anything else.\\n\\nThe food was cold. Nothing is sadder than a pizza that has sat closed in a box and allowed to cool off except for chicken wings that have sat wrapped in foil in a box and allow to cool off.\\n\\nThe pizza just sucked, the sauce was light on top of the fact that it was cold and the cheese was skimped on as well.\\n\\nThe wings were inedible. When you get chicken wings and they are fried or baked you expect them to be crispy. That is part of the experience of the wing that makes them so good.\\n\\nThe skin on these wings was like limp rubbery flesh. It was disgusting and there was no saving them at that point since the sauce was on them.\\n\\nAll and all the experience left a bad taste in our mouths. While I understand that places are slammed with the pandemic this is the time for them to shine, not slack. You either put out your best work or you go down in flames.\\n\\nMy business will go with someone else who can deliver a quality tasty (and edible) product next time.\", \"Smelled like sewage when you walk in and the scent follows you throughout the establishment. The waiters barely check in on you and the food took forever for it being extremely slow... when you finally do get your food (I ordered a Caesar) it was served on a plate that was literally hot to the touch... making the salad itself lukewarm and wilted upon arrival. Friend ordered the tri-tip with asparagus which was extremely limp and not fresh at all. The prices for the quality and treatment is ridiculous. Moved to the bar to watch the baseball game and the tables were sticky and uncleaned. I'd be more lenient if it were a Friday or Saturday night but this was a dead Sunday evening where the most action was a metaphorical tumbleweed blowing through the restaurant. Sad because this place used to be so busy. For an old, mining themed restaurant, it really feels like a ghost town in here. \\n\\n  Our server was nice, I feel bad for him.....\", \"Had the worst customer service experience I've had in my whole life at this Taco Bell. I accidentally ordered an online pickup at a different Taco Bell. Upon getting to this Taco Bell they told me I'd just have to go to the other Taco Bell then told me to leave the drive thru. I called the other Taco Bell asked them if they could cancel my order they told me they could just call the Taco Bell and request they make my order there I said perfect. They called me back and said this Broadway Taco Bell was refusing to do that but they told me to go in and talk to Jeffrey. I go in the restaurant wait behind several people ask for Jeffrey then wait a long time for him to come talk to me. He explains it would mess up their profits by 5 dollars to just make the food for me even though Taco Bell has already been paid. I said are you serious what's more important 5 dollars in profit loss even though Taco Bell has already been paid or losing a customer for life. He goes and talks to his GM in ear shot of me his GM says absolutely not we can't just make it for him he comes back and says oh no we can't do that. I wasted 40 minutes of my time paid for food and never even got it. Completely unacceptable. I recommend never going to this Taco Bell terrible customer service and staff. Worst experience ever.\", \"We received probably the worst service we have had in a very long time.  The line didn't look too bad until we were told they were spacing out taking orders, and it would be a bit of a wait because they were short handed.  Yes, they are new, but one would think a manager could better manage a restaurant.  Each worker gave a different amount of wait time.  While they did take a drink order they could not move the line at a reasonable rate.  We were there 1 1/ 2 to get a simple burrito.  We counted over 7 employees out front, some just standing and chatting.  Did they consider cross training in a situation such as this?  No one was stepping up and trying to help.  While the food was good, sad it was such an unpleasant visit.  Unless the manager learns how to manage her staff, stay away if you don't want to wait for over an hour for your food.\", 'Last chance and an epic fail 20 min wait for the teriyaki chicken waited in line soooo long for over priced mediocre food , sorry panda you lost four customers forever! Get your act together', 'Every time I come to this location they are always out of something and the wait time is outrageous for the few people they have in line. They are extremely unorganized. The worst customer service Panda location.', \"I don't understand the appeal to this place at all. The service was horrendous, the beer was expired, the mimosas were absolutely horrible nothing but juice! The coffee tasted like toilet water. The waitress acted like she was too busy when it wasn't even that busy. The food was very very Bland. People's taste buds must be shit to enjoy this place.

One couple said they hadn\\'t moved in line for 25 minutes. There was no reported  illness or a failure of people to show up for work, just seems like they don\\'t have their management down yet.

If this kid doesn\\'t lose his job, I will contact every McDonald\\'s ceo and upper management until he does. There was another young kid there that also came over and started yelling at us and telling me they would get security in which I told him to go ahead.

      "Document about 'waiting time' in star 5 reviews: [\"My husband and I received a gift certificate from Charro Steak.  We looked at the menu and said WOW! We were not disappointed.  The food is fabulous, the staff is very responsive and we had a wonderful experience.  Make sure you make a reservation as it a very popular restaurant.  Lucky for us we received another gift certificate.  We can't wait to go back!!\", \"Came here celebrating law school graduation and it was the perfect place. Can't wait to get back soon.\", \"What a great place to now have in town here! The vibe is modern and comfortable. We were greeted and sat as soon as we came in. We went before 5pm so we were able to take advantage of their amazing drink specials $5 pitchers of beer and $5 glasses of wine. I had rosè and it was so refreshing & crisp, and I loved it. My husbamd got Sippin pretty which was a delicious and fresh tasting sour beer. We ordered prosciutto with brie and the bruschetta board plus 2 additional bruschetta. We got moz tomato and basil, warm artichoke, smoked salmon and pesto, burrata bacon arugula, and sweet n spicy jam w goat cheese. All were aaammmzzzsiiinnggg! Salmon and pesto were our favorite. This is a great spot for couples date night or brunch with friends. I can't wait to return!\", 'I love this place and their food our waitress Diana is amazing....chicken tacos are very good and we have had several family dinners there continue the good work', \"My son and I visited previously and picked up some bakery items.  I'm glad I waited to do a review until I'd had a meal.  My son enjoyed his french toast while my crepes and biscuits and gravy were perfection!  Everything was delicious!  This is a perfect breakfast and I'm looking forward to visiting again.\", 'Great service from krystal!!! \\nAwesome food and very patient on their toes wait staff!\\nI got the filet and chicken with basmati rice!!!\\nAmazing!!!', \"Such a great first experience here! I have been to Phoenix locations and was so excited when Postino opened in Tucson. With COVID and everything happening, didn't get here until now. Superb service, clean environment, not crowded and well socially distanced and again, amazing and friendly service. Can't wait to come back!\", \"Absolutely delicious! From Phoenix and was in the area for a mini weekend trip. We ended up at this place for brunch and all FIVE (couldn't make up our mind for 3 people) things we ordered did NOT disappoint. It's definitely a popular local place as there was a wait. But the wait is worth it\", \"Wow! We visited this place yesterday for lunch and it certainly did not disappoint. The atmosphere was so lively and fun, and the food was delicious! Their menu is small but I think that's nice because the quality of each food item is top notch. For appetizers we ordered fresh guacamole and chips - I couldn't stop eating them. Then we also tried the nachos - mouth drooling. So good! For my main menu item I asked for a Birria Burro which wasn't in the menu but they made it, and it was so flavorful and just a very filling burrito. My sister ordered the chicken tortilla soup and that also looked so delicious! Loved the ambiance and would come back again. They have outdoor dining as well. With COVID, they also have shields between each table inside which I liked. This layer of safety also didn't take away from the visual appeal of the aesthetic. So that was nice. Can't wait to come back. And I know parking can be a deterrent when it comes to downtown but they're actually right across the street from the parking garage so I considered that a bonus too!\", 'Came here for a birthday dinner. It was pretty busy we had to wait about 30 minutes. (Wish they had nowait!). Postinos is always delicious. My go-to is the 9-iron sandwich and my wife usually gets the bruschetta board.\\n\\nIt is also welcoming to see gluten free bread available as someone in our party had a gluten allergy. Will be back!', \"Called in order. Didn't wait long and was able to pay and take the most amazing food home! Tacos yaqui, large caramelos, carne asada tacos and chipilons with everything! Highly recommend it!\", \"After seeing all the pictures, I had to check this place out and our visit turned out as expected. YUM. It's a small restaurant, but cozy. If you go alone, you might be seated with someone you don't know. That's normal in Europe, but not usual in my experience in America. Because it's small and busy, you could also experience a wait, but it won't be long because their service is quick. Note their operation hours as they are closed between lunch and dinner. The food is an amazing presentation and the taste is even better. We also tried the hiro mule and it was quite tasty as well. The only negative (not for the restaurant), is you will probably have to park down the street in the residential areas since the parking lot is super small.\", \"Absolutely amazing service and delicious food. We were there last night for my mother n laws birthday and it was a large party with kids. Our waiter was accommodating to my allergies and treated our kids the same as the adults. He was so polite and friendly. He even opened the door for us as we were leaving. Absolutely great time. Will go again when I'm back in Tucson.\", \"We're from Oakland visiting in laws here and no restaurants were open early except this one as we left Tucson. \\n\\nAlso noticed that folks dont use Yelp as much as folks in Cali. This place just based on their breakfast burrito was soooo damn good! The tortilla was bomb and as someone who doesnt like beans...these beans are hella good!! Definitely one of those spots that feels like a Mexican grandma with a hanging elbow making something so simple tastes amazing. Also the man who took my order was hilarious and kind. Thanks Maico! Cant wait to visit Tucson again for this.\", \"Anxiously waited for Postino to open in Tucson since we'd been to the Scottsdale location. We were fortunate to go to soft opening. All I can say is WOW! Complimentary food with 2 drinks per person was awesome. We tried butcher block, every bruschetta, meatballs, and 3 desserts. Service was wonderful. Melissa took great care of us, but we had numerous others checking to make sure we were taken care of. Location is just right being across from Culinary Dropout and next door to Snooze (opening soon). Went for second time and had 1/2 panini and salad. Amber was our server and was great!\\nThis has quickly become our new fav place! Brunch is next.\", \"This place is awesome!  Calye, Brittany, Erika, Julie and everyone here are fanfreakintastic!  New food menu is pretty fuego!   Beer is great and always getting better, I can't wait till they get the full bar!\", 'Always a good choice for amazing food. To beat the rush we always go 2 hours prior to closing time. Usually we never have to wait long for a table.', \"Our waiter was named Lee, he was very attentive and eager to serve us. We had an absolutely wonderful meal, even with minor set backs such as a ravioli mix up. He immediately took care and recognized the problem and resolved it with the right order. My glass was cracked and leaking (was not his fault) and he changed and apologized for the mistake. It's servers like him, that keep me wanting to come back for more. He made great recommendations to order and I was very pleased with the delicious food as well.\", 'This place is amazing!!..we had to wait an hour for a table (on Saturday night) but it was so worth it.great service and delicious food. I had the #4 combo and she had the #5..freakin amazing!!..great service!!.. if you love Mexican, eat here before you die', \"I've been super excited to try this relatively new lunch spot downtown. The stylish decor includes bright pastel ceilings, artwork in primary colors and muted talaverna-style tile patterns that all blend together into a comfortable and trendy atmosphere. \\n\\nThe interior space is not divided into sections, and with nothing but hard surfaces in all directions, the acoustics are echoey, making conversation a little challenging. Some soft sound panels on the ceiling or one of the walls would really help soak up the rando chatter. \\n\\nThe Pineapple Margarita ($12) was light, with a muted pineapple flavor, a fresh pineapple wedge and served in a seasoned glass. Yum. \\n\\nThe chips that came with the Guacamole ($3) were crisp and nicely seasoned. And the salsa roja had a deep roasted flavor with a nice slow heat. The guac itself was a bit heavy on the bitter cumin and lacked a touch of saltiness. But it blended well with the chips and salsa. \\n\\nThe Trio De Enchiladas ($16) included birria con salsa roja, pollo con mole negro, and camarón con salsa suiza. Delicious! I ate every bit of this dish. Even the creamy pinto beans, fresh salad with pico and lightly seasoned rice with cilantro. The salsas are the stand-out here. In particular, the mole is fantastic. I prefer moles that don't taste like a candy bar. And this one hits the pallet with only a hint of chocolate amongst its layers of roasted flavor. And the suiza is wonderful. This is a salsa verde finished with a bit of dairy, named after Swiss immigrants who, as the legend goes, brought with them to Mexico rich cream to put into spicy salsa. Yummmmm. \\n\\nAt $16 this dish is a bargain. Especially compared to other downtown spots like Charro Del Rey that charge $30 for for something similar, yet are not nearly as delicious. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that the flavor of each of the proteins falls a little short of the richness of the salsas. A little more seasoning within the protein itself and I would pay twice the price for this dish and be happy about it. \\n\\nI've read some reviews that complained about the wait and/or the service. We came on a Wednesday afternoon and were immediately seated, and we had a drink in hand less than five minutes later. So I did not notice any problems with the service. Also, the bathrooms are clean and frequently serviced. And everything is COVID compliant too, including nicely styled outdoor seating. \\n\\nOverall, a La Chingada is wonderful. Check it out on a week day when it's not as busy. But even still, I wouldn't be upset about waiting for 30 minutes for a seat. The food, service and prices are fantastic.\", 'We have not had their regular food yet, but after trying this Thanksgiving meal we will be back. \\n\\nFirst, the waitress and staff were amazing!!! Everyone was very friendly and positive even working on Thanksgiving. Our waitress in particular was excellent, she was attentive, helpful and a delight to chat with this evening.  The ambiance was ok, the chairs were a bit hard and uncomfortable for length of the meal but perhaps it fits with the normal menu. The decor was cute, we were on the del Rey side, and echoed the surf and turf theme.\\n\\nWe had the turkey and Prim Rib, both were very juicy and flavorful but a bit cool. The prime rib was perfectly prepared and the highlight of the two meat dishes. The turkey was good, with the both the white and dark meat being moist. The highlight for the turkey and the mashed potatoes was the gravy which had a nice spice to it and really elevated both the potatoes and the turkey. The stuffing was really well done which a similar bit of heat and spice as the gravy. The cranberries were fresh, not canned, and the corn was prepared in a style similar to an elote street salad with a nice amount of citric acid to cut through all the fat elsewhere in the meal.\\n\\nWe started with the cast iron mushrooms stuffed with chorizo, which was not greasy and had a great balance against the cream sauce it was stewed in, and we end with two of the deserts. The pumpkin tamale was not too sweet and a nice smooth ending to the meal. The chocolate tres leche with peanut butter icing was sweeter but very moist and all the flavors were very balanced. The place had a nice selection of drinks including wine and whiskey.\\n\\nOverall, we were very impressed with the balance of the flavor profiles and some of the food stumbles were not severe particularly considering how busy they were on Thanksgiving. It is this flavor balance and the amazing staff that really stole the night for us.  Food we would rate around a 4-5, ambiance a 3-4, but the staff were easily a 5.', 'Big fan of postino. They have a big selection of amazing wines. I got an arugula salad with brussel sprouts and it was delicious. Get the bruscettas. All of them were AMAZING. The waiters were very friendly and attentive. The ambiance is very stylish for Tucson.', 'Really tasty food and baked goods. Would definitely be back again. Fair warning, the baked stuff sells out pretty quickly and there can be a hefty wait.', \"First time. My wife and I were very pleased with our lunches. Dined in during the pandemic. Our food arrived in less than 5 minutes. Red Chile and taco plates were on point, and the waitress was super! We'll be back soon.\", 'You walk through the doorway and are greeted with a smile and comfortable chatter.\\nThe waitstaff are friendly and efficient. The food choices are a bit different from the usual brunch fare and are delicious. The everything croissant breakfast is sandwich crazy good and the poutine is so yummy, you can add friend chicken (we did), which made it even tastier. Get here early though to be seated quickly.', \"I had heard really good things about this place from friends, but I never had the opportunity to go myself. I ended up going with my boyfriend the other day since we figured ramen would help his upset stomach. Since COVID happened we had to wait a little due to the limited seating cause of social distancing, but the wait wasn't too bad. The service was great and the food was amazing, overall it was a great experience. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm most definitely going back for more\", \"You have to have the Sonoran Dog.  I keep thinking about it, in Wyoming.  It was delicious.  I also loved the Raspberry Ale.  Our waitress was great.  I don't remember her name, but she was pregnant (she didn't look pregnant, but she was). The vibe was fabulous, but the service was better.   We tried several appetizers and they were all delicious.  The burgers were great and the amber beer was great too.  Can't wait to visit Tucson again.\", 'Ok, this place is AMAZING!!! Came here on a whim and so glad we did!! Atmosphere is great, very hip and \"cool\" but not stuffy. We sat at the bar. Zach, our waiter, was phenomenal. Happy hour is unreal. $20 bottles of wine!!!! Amazing. We go the meat balls, the butcher block, and some bruschetta - everything was amazing!!! The best bruschetta was the bacon, burrata, and tomato, but again, everything was awesome. We were a bit skeptical since this place is so new (only opened a week and a half ago!) but it was like a well oiled machine. Seriously phenomenal all around. Can\\'t wait to be back, AND check out the phx locations!!!', \"Absolutely phenomenal. We were visiting Tucson for 4 days and we came here 3 times. We were greeted with a beautiful bright and open seating area and an incredibly nice hostess. I saw some pastries in a glass case on my walk to the table and knew this was going to be good. I speak for all 3 times I've been here when I say the waitstaff are so friendly and helpful with making suggestions for the menu. \\n\\nAll 3 things I ordered were delicious but my favorite was the green chile french toast, they absolutely nailed it. Everything they do though has pizazz. Even their most basic dishes have a flare to them, which I love. \\n\\nAnother perk of coming three times was that I was also able to try three different drinks...vacation right? They have a lengthy cocktail menu of incredibly unique looking concoctions, as well as an entire list of different mimosas. They will still serve them on weekdays and not just weekend brunch...which is great for those vacationing where everyday is a weekend! I opted to try a few mimosas, and while all were excellent, my favorite was the rose lemon. Exceptional. \\n\\nNow the pastries...: Our first time there our sweet waiter brought us a tiramisu cronut on the house because we were new and WOW was it delicious (and also such a kind gesture). Definitely sold me on wanting to try more of their pastries. The next two times I took a pastry to go for later in the day...vacation right? I was able to try their earl grey scone and their stuffed apple brioche donut. They also change them daily so it's always a new surprise what they will have. My only complaint is that we still had another four days in a different part of Arizona and pastries wouldn't stay fresh enough for me to take home with me! My waistline thanks me but my tummy was sad. \\n\\nI rarely say a long wait is worth it, but for this place it really is.\", 'We are not from the area, but are passing through and craving decent ramen. We were impressed with the Yelp Reviews and rating for this establishment so we gave it a try.\\nThe basics: The business location may look like it\\'s a hole in the wall with the cramped and small parking lot. However, the inside it looks clean and taste fully decorated. The staff were also friendly. The wait for the pick up was exactly as stated (30 minutes). Kudos for that since our navigation system indicated it should take us approximately 20 minutes to get there from our rental.\\nThe order: Spicy Tonkotsu and Regular Tonkotsu. The order was to go (not for dine/in), so we were anticipating that when we do get back to our place to eat, it wouldn\\'t be as enjoyable. We were pleasantly surprised that it wasn\\'t the case as the meal was scrumptious! The broth for both were tasty, the pork in each serving was tender, and the egg halves for each order was perfectly cooked. We\\'ll be back for more next time we\\'re in the area and try other dishes (maybe even an appetizer or two). Thank you, Raijin!\\nFYI - We have been here in the Tucson area since March and should be leaving soon. Since our stay, we have mostly been sheltering in place, but on occasion do place orders for pick up or to go. Of all the places we\\'ve been to, we have not been able to write a Yelp review until now; therefore, the numerous Yelp reviews written in the past hour or so is simply due to us being able to actually take the time to write them. This is not a fake account or review and we simply provide our reviews based on OUR experience and taste buds/preference (same as other Yelpers). So for those who address our reviews as \"fake\" (Teaholic), that is your opinion and are entitled to it. Obviously the other reviews we wrote while we\\'re here in Tucson aren\\'t all bad (low in number of stars). Take for example this review of Ni Hao, Rocco\\'s, Guadalajara\\'s, Back Dough, and Raijin :)', \"Last time I was here to have lunch with my friend was on May 19th. 2019\\nI don't know who was a manager there but he was very rude and so has the waitress:(\\nThe problem is started with the waitress and the manager didn't even apologize or give us another table to sit down and eat so I was really upset for the first time visiting his place since I left California after 41 years and my friend usually orders food from this place for the heart place to work so her co-workers could have food at meetings!\\nShe got upset & promised not to ever come back\\nAnd on top of everything else DM never got back to us:(\\nSo today me and my friend decided to come to have lunch here:)\\nThis time the waitress Daniela was very helpful friendly and so as the manager who was in charge with a dark blue shirt which we didn't get his name as well as another gentleman who welcomed the store to this establishment:)\\nThis time I like to give everybody five stars especially Daniela and the food was good we'll wil be back again I don't know when but we will:)\", \"I am a big breakfast and brunch eater when I visit Tucson. Their amazing selection of restaurants for breakfast makes it my favorite meal of the day. Prep & Pastry makes that list of must go to spots!\\n\\nThere is usually a wait time because the place is so popular. They have a great selection of mimosas. My favorite dish is the chicken and french toast. I want to try other things on the menu, but can't bring myself to deviate from the spectacular flavor filled dish. \\n\\nThis is a place to go with friends, family, or by yourself. The food is amazing. The staff is busy running around serving everyone. They are efficient at their job. It is amazing to see how they glide around each other and make it almost look like a dance.\", \"Always a good choice for food, happy hour or just drinks (not just beer).. hidden off Toole only minutes from downtown.. this place is truly a hidden gem. \\n\\nI usually have a burger or sandwich with fries when I visit, but they have great salads and happy hour deals also.. wings, potato skins, chicken strips.. etc\\n\\nOn my recent visit I had the black & blue burger .. Cajun spice with Gorgonzola.. first of all it's huge! The menu says it's spicy.. I didn't think so.\\n\\nI paired it with a salad .. even though I wanted the fries.. because they are delicious .. as are the onion rings or beer battered fries.. I also enjoy their barrio margarita with Tajín rim. \\n\\nThey do also sell beer to-go. The hostess is waiting for you outside, she gets you seated right away.. inside, outside & bar seating available. Wait staff is friendly, I've never had a long wait for food or drinks.\", \"Couldn't decide what I wanted to eat so many choices on the menu.   Even though there was a longer wait for our large party the food sounded no delicious that it was definitely worth the wait.    There's a wait list of Yelp but maybe because of covid they weren't using it.   \\n\\nI ordered the preps breakfast sammie with a over medium egg instead of scrabbled, something about runny yolk in a sandwich always gets me.   The bacon and potatoes with my meal get a special mention since it made the dish, so so good.    Since I went with others got to taste a few other delicious dishes like the Monte Cristo, steak and egg sandwich, breakfast poutine.  And what's breakfast without mimosas.  My favorite was the Madras.  \\n\\nLoved their pastries section but unfortunately I was too full after brunch that I didn't get to try anything more than the cookie which hit the spot after my meal.   \\n\\nStaff was very friendly and food came out pretty quickly.   Great breakfast/brunch spot!!!\", \"This place is proof positive if you serve good food you will be a successful restaurant, even when you open during a pandemic.  We were here on a recent Sunday afternoon.  Wait time was 40 minutes.  So we waited.  We ended up with a table on their sidewalk patio area.  It was perfect.  The service was great even with a full restaurant.  The cocktails were delicious and beautifully presented.  I had this chamoy slushy martini with tajin.  Yummy.  The guacamole was fresh and some of the best I've had.  On the chilaquilas you get red and green sauce.  Both were bursting with flavor.  My husband had the tamale and egg.  The tamale was the perfect consistency and flavor.  The restaurant has a bar inside and about 10 tables.  Can't wait to go back and try their enchiladas!\", 'Really great breakfast place. \\n\\nThe food is delicious, and the prices match evenly. Really good coffee here and the wait staff are all professionals. \\n\\nI was very impressed. Will come here again.', 'The food here was amazing, but the service that Charlie provided as our waitress was absolutely amazing.  10/10 would come back here again if for no other reason than the great service she provided.  The food was also amazing, but there is something to be said for great service!  We will be back!', 'Neapolitan style wood fired pizza!!  Crisp crust, perfect rich flavors on the Ortolana white pizza, with mushrooms, artichoke hearts, arugula and added anchovies. $30 for a shared salad, pizza and gelatos. Watching pies hauled out of the oven is entertaining too. Make a reservation to avoid a wait. Oh. And service is excellent', \"Drooling thinking about them right now. Best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. Menu has soooo many great options. Can't wait to go back. Had the eggs Bennie with pork belly. Holy smokes. So good. Just go. You won't regret it. In fact the only thing you'll regret is how much you ate and drank while you were there because you couldn't stop eating. Legit one of my fav brunch spots in Tucson.\", \"It's tough to say this is the best pizza in Tucson when there are so many good places. But it's the best.  Worth the 45 minute drive from SE Tucson to get there.  Worth the wait. \\nThe on-site wood-fried oven is expertly manned by the owner, who turns around more pizza per human than I've ever seen. I love just sitting and waiting, smelling the deliciousness over a glass of wine, watching the well-oiled kitchen move pizzas faster than your eyes tell you is possible. \\nThere's many good joints around town. This is the best.\", \"Decided to try this place out after finding them on Instagram - ordered my food for pickup through their online menu which was very clean, designed well, and easy to navigate. I LOVE being able to order for pickup online, it just makes my life easier. \\n\\nI showed up a little before they were finished cooking but the server was extremely kind and made sure to keep me updated on its progress even though I didn't have to wait for very long. She also rushed out the door to bring me the side of rice they had missed, which I greatly appreciate! \\n\\nOnce I brought the food home and opened my bag I was pleasantly surprised to see that the portions for the Steak Bento Don and Fish Bento Don were ENORMOUS - way more than I was expecting!! I also ordered the fried dumplings and the crab puffs. The dumplings were solid, but the crab puffs were EASILY the best I have ever had, just absolutely delicious. And my Fish Don was also extremely flavorful and delicious and I would definitely order it again. I also ordered a milk tea that was really good and not too sweet, just how I like it! \\n\\nAll in all I had a very positive experience, and while I generally don't do dine-in these days, i noticed that the restaurant looked very clean and the few tables available were very widely spaced out which is nice. I also like its modern aesthetic. I live pretty far south of this place but I will definitely be returning, especially for those crab puffs!\", \"Had been here a few years back on vacation, and the food and drinks were amazing! When family was coming into Tucson to stay for a week, we wanted to get them a gift card here to have a great experience. I emailed the manager, Brennen, on the best way to get that to them, and he promptly wrote back within a few minutes. He said it wouldn't be a problem to call him and purchase it over the phone and have it waiting for them when they came in. He went as far to take a pic of my receipt, the gift card, and envelope with their names on it. They came in the next day, and had a great dinner and beer...or 3. :D\\nIt's going above and beyond to serve your customers that really stood out to me. Brennen is top-notch, and know Barrio's is blessed to have him!\", \"For sure will be returning here. Service and food were excellent. Food looks just like all pictures lol!! Place was jam packed - suggest getting there early lunch and early dinner. They close at 3pm and reopen at 5pm for dinner. It was worth the wait. Place is intimate good for group or date night! Parking garage directly across the street, I paid a whoppin 2$ on a Sat. Can't wait to come here again...\", \"BEST WINGS EVERRRRRRR!!!! I was introduced to Buffalo Bell about ten years ago and, even after moving away from Tucson, have NEVER forgotten them. Was lucky enough to stop by today and the wings were EXACTLY the same! You can't beat their honey mustard wings with a side of buffalo fries. It's been 4 hours or so since I had them and can't wait to stop again tomorrow before heading out of town. GREAT food! Their honeydew and taro drinks are AWESOME too!\", 'This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Tucson! Staff is super friendly. Sometimes it can be very busy and you have to wait outside ( because of covid) but its worth it! Calling it in ahead of time will definitely help with the wait.', \"August Rhodes Market is now August Rhodes Bakery! While I am sad that their lovely sandwiches are gone for the time being, I am delighted to still have their bread!\\n\\nThis morning, I stopped in just after opening and got an oven-hot loaf of olive-pistachio sourdough bread and a package of six English muffins. The sourdough was nothing short of heavenly. When I got home, it was still very warm, and the fragrance when I cut into it was so beguiling I had to stop myself from ripping chunks off to eat without so much as sitting down, much less getting a plate. I did control myself long enough to get some butter and jam, which melted gorgeously into the pockets and crannies of the warm slices. (I will neither confirm nor deny whether breakfast entirely consisted of four thick slices of this loaf with various jams.) \\n\\nThe sourdough had the perfect tang, was light and airy, with just the right textural balance of the soft interior and the crisp crust. The olives and pistachios dotted throughout gave it a savory depth that I loved. I can't wait to try my English muffins, and go back next weekend to try more types of bread!\\n\\nAugust Rhodes will be open Thursday through Sunday from 9 a.m. until they sell out, but do yourself a favor and get there early so your chosen loaves will be still be warm when you buy them... and then eat them immediately.\", 'Christine is the absolute best waitress! I felt the restaurant was very clean and safe. Food and wine made for a great night with friends!', \"We love raijin ramen! me and my boyfriend come here at least twice a week. We both order the spicy ramen and it is devine! The staff is very friendly and will help you right away. Anthony is our favorite waiter, he is the best! The food service is so quick, if you're looking for a formal sit down this might not be your place but for a quick cheap bite to eat 10/10 would recommend this place!\", \"I dreamt about donuts last night so I woke up and went online to hunt for a donut shop that wasn't Dunkin' near me? I initially went to Amy's Donuts, which understandably is closed, so then I went to Donut King on Grant & Stone. I'm glad I went there!\\n\\nI got the cinnamon crunch donut and the cookies & crème blended iced coffee.\\n\\nThe two people working were friendly and were manning both the front counter and drive-thru at the same time. I didn't feel like I waited a long time for my drink either!\\n\\nI will definitely be coming back whenever I have a donut craving!\", 'Perfect! Finally Tucson gets an authentic, real ramen experience like the big cities have had for quite some time! Seriously no shills, feels straight out of Tokyo style! Long waits can happen at peak times though so definitely manage your expectations!', 'Amazing as always! I was so delighted to see the parking lot full at P&P this morning. People, including staff, were practicing healthy social distancing. The woman taking and retrieving orders had an intense \"I\\'m really busy - gotta do this and this and this\" look on her face but she was doing great and was super efficient and friendly. I got the chicken and toast, biscuits and gravy, and a dossant (yes, all for me cause I only get take out once or twice a month in this crazy time). They all taste perfect. Can\\'t wait to eat leftovers tomorrow! All my pics show half-eaten good cause I couldn\\'t wait to dig in.', \"My husband and I finally decided that it was time to get out and try to have some fun. With the heat, outside really wasn't an option for us. We thought we would give the casino a try. We walked in to find a temperature checkpoint for anyone entering the building and machines spaced. Literally they have spaced every machine, added shields in between machines, taken a ballroom and converted it into a new play area. I have never felt safer! New satellite bars where placed in several areas to ensure you could get drinks without a need to wait in line or socially distancing. You couldn't help but notice continual cleaning of all machines at all times either. It was fun, we had great service and would highly recommend to anyone!\", \"This place is great can't wait till it's all back to normal. Awesome location for lunch dinner drinks events and Great service. YOUNG leads by example as is the hardest worker(boss) in the building.

Can you get much better than your neighborhood tortilla place? Spotless and simple environment? Check! Surprisingly expansive menu? Also check! \\n\\nI had no idea La Mesa existed; I stumbled across it today when I was intending to go to Ferguson to get a replacement part for the tub faucet, only to find it closed. Surely, there had to be another reason to drive all the way out from Oro Valley. This was, apparently, the reason to do so. I took a glance at the menu, and all looked good, but I was in a tamale mood; I had not had one since Winter. I took home half a dozen green corn, and half a dozen red chile beef. This place really goes with what works as far as tamale-making is concerned. Occasionally, you will run across a place that will try to re-invent the wheel, causing something to get lost in translation. Not the case here. These tamales are every bit as good as tamales that I know and love. They are not dried out, they are flavorful, and filling. They were a hit at home; all have been eaten.\\n\\nI cannot wait to try other items on their menu!', \"Where do I start? Don't be fooled by the long line outside, you won't wait more than 20 minutes even at the busiest time here. The dude at the front door with the clipboard is the real OG and gets people checked in and seated promptly. Great waitstaff, very polite and knowledgeable with good recommendations.

Excellent service, my friends and I love the environment at Barrio. Can't wait to come back.\", \"Extensive, varied, and delicious menu with plenty of veggie options. Delicious coffee and excellent service. We arrived at 8:45 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait, but by 9 there was already a growing wait as it was still too chilly for their many outdoor tables. Would definitely return.\", \"Very, very good. This was my third visit, and tried the Spicy Miso Ramen. Pork base, curly noodles, chashu (marinated pork), menma (bamboo shoots), scallions, seaweed, corn and tamago (egg). The broth is perfectly balanced, and the bowl is filling. No shortage of fine quality ingredients, which has eagerly brought me back. The owners also own Ginza Sushi at Sunrise and Kolb, one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town, and Jun usually takes Sundays off from sushi to make the broths here. If you're looking for authentic ramen, I highly recommend Raijin Ramen. The space is clean, the service efficient and quick. Lunch hours can be crowded, so I recommend going earlier than noon or after the rush at 1:30 if you want to be seated without waiting. Without a doubt, my favorite go-to for ramen.\", 'The best Mexican food in all of Tucson, honestly. I\\'ve seen this place posted all over the Tucson Foodie blog for some time and it was always on our \"places to tey\" list. Coincidentally, on Cinco de Mato, we happened to be near the restaurant and decided to check it out. Since the actual restaurant was bot permitted to dine-in at that time, we stood in line for their food truck that was put in the parking lot. It was pretty much a standard wait time for a food truck (especially when they are making real food on-the-spot) and the prices were incredibly affordable. They packed everything up and gave us a ton of their various salsas to try. When we got home, we couldn\\'t believe how good everything looked and it tasted even better. I honestly can\\'t pick a favorite thing that we had (pork adobada, carne asada, chicken caramel, some weird but amazing taco cooked inside a chile).

Try the Board - you get to choose any four (all great) and they slice them each into four pieces for easy sharing. the avocado toast with egg for brunch was above any I've ever had. \\nAnd save room- oh man, the chocolate dessert with vanilla ice cream and the smooth flan were share worth and so worth it!

I got the pollo (chicken), the adobada (marinated pork), and the carne asada (grilled steak). All three were good, but the carne asada was definitely my favorite, followed by the adobada. The meats were super flavorful, and not greasy at all, which I very much appreciated. \\n\\nThe tacos were on the smaller side, but served with delicious grilled scallions and a variety of excellent salsas. \\n\\nThey of course have a variety of tortas, burritos, and other offerings along with tacos, and I can't wait to try more!\", \"I'd definitely order in advance and take out unless you want to wait a bit.. there was a pretty decent line for people dining in.. food was amazing after a rainy day\", 'Had the best breakfast EVER!!

I had a cup of nitro cold brew before my meal, it was nicely extracted and smooth with a lovely acidity. I don\\'t know what brand they serve but I loved it.

It was like a cake based french toast it was the best and unique to anywhere else. Now the French toast is just tasteless bread that taste more like overpriced frozen French toast sprinkled with cinnamon and given a fancy name to make it sound special, \"churro French toast\".

I highly recommend you try them!\", 'This review is coming from a non-pork eater who loves ramen. I usually get vegan/veggie ramen at most ramen places since all the other options are pork, but I was so happy to see this place had a chicken option. And on top of that, the chicken ramen was excellent! Really flavorful, and I added the spicy garlic which I highly recommend if you like spicy ramen.

The new bar is wonderfully comfortable, and the food and service are great.   The bar area lighting is just right too.   Not too bright.

They never disappoint. The attention to customers is always above and beyond and the food is always overly satisfying. The menu is pretty extensive which I love. I've ordered different dishes on each visit and have always left satisfied to the core by each. This time around, I ordered the carne asada steak and enchilada plate (No. 45). The carne asada was a more-than-decent size for me and found it to be super flavorful, tender, and perfectly cooked. The enchiladas are good here, but I have to mention,  it's different from what I'm used to. Their red sauce has more of a tomato taste to it rather than the taste of spices and dried chilis which is fine with me. Just mentioning in case that may be a deal breaker for you. My BF ordered the mole enchilada dish which he orders on every visit. And, of course, he loved it. Thank you.\", 'Had a wonderful dinner served by Erica. She was a great resource as we had never had Persian food before. I will be  recommending this restaurant to ALL my friends!', \"Wow, so good! I loved the atmosphere and I loved the food even more.

I am from California and I used to think we had the best Mexican food but ever since visiting Tucson I have to say Arizona has the best Mexican food!

Happy Hour gives you half off appetizers and select drinks. \\n\\nThe service was amazing. I wished I remembered my servers name because he was too notch. The food was great. I had the carne asada fries and they were soooo good. The only downfall was that I ordered a martini surprise and the bartender did not have the blue cheese stuffed olives.

When we pulled into the parking lot, the lot was almost completely full, which we took as a good sign in terms of food quality. We were not disappointed. It took us 40 minutes to drive home and the food was miraculously still warm (so, A+ effort on their packaging/wrapping abilities). We order a plate of carne asada, chile Colorado, and some churros. The carne asada was well-cooked and seasoned, but we did have to break out our kitchen shears to cut it up for easier consumption. The chile Colorado was flavorful, but not too spicy, and had plenty of beef in it. Both plates came with a side of rice and beans (the beans were excellent and not soupy, but creamy). I'm not a fan of churros, but my husband really enjoyed them. So, if you're looking for a place that does plated-Mexican classics really well, this is the spot!\", \"Update: Since the pandemic began I have pretty much gotten take out from here every. Single.

We really enjoyed sitting at the bar the first time there and enjoying breakfast and watching the bartender make drinks. This time due to social distancing requirements we were seated outside. I ordered the prep omelet with potatoes and hubs got the basic breakfast. We also ordered a cinnamon roll with bourbon bacon. I enjoyed the omelet with spinach, goat cheese and avocado. The potatoes were really good and sort of unusual in their preparation (crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside). The bacon here is sort of candied which is a real surprising delight. The cinnamon roll is not like the average cinnamon roll. It's more like a pastry than the usual gummy mess that normally passes as a cinnamon roll. It's texture was really food and the icing was nice and but not overpowering or sweet. Also had cute candied bacon garnish. I would love to indulge more often here but $40 is a bit much for breakfast.

We generally go for special occasions or date nights because it is on the pricier side, bug we are rarely let down. We most recently attended the prix fixe meal for Valentine's and it is a great way to try something you wouldn't ordinarily order or even have access to. I'm a notoriously picky eater, but I still enjoy all of the dishes that are offered. So, don't be afraid of fine dining if you're normally a picky person. They also source almost all of their food from Arizona vendors. My favorite things here are the vegetarian dishes, so you can't go wrote with any of those options. \\n\\nThe alcohol and wine selection are wonderful here and we have been able to take advantage of a sommelier service in the past. Check this place out sooner rather than later.\", \"Amazing food! The tacos were the best and so many options for toppings. Some of the best tacos I've ever had!! Will be coming again & again!\", \"Tried it for the first time since it's about a mile from my house and been looking for an alternative to Olive Garden for Italian food. \\n\\nI got the chicken Parmesan and was impressed! Spaghetti noodles were a perfect consistency. The chicken was perfectly grilled on the outside and juicy on inside. Ample amount of cheese. \\nThey even brought it right to my car and it was still piping hot, which was nice.\\n\\nAll in all, loved the dish and will def come again to try something else. I'll probably go for the wings next time!\", \"I recently got a job close by and my coworkers recommended I try this place during the lunch buffet. It's clean, a decent sized restaurant (it looked smaller from the outside) and the lunch buffet was delicious. I was able to try a little of everything and was pleased by all the variety of flavors! I would recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area or just have a craving for indian food in general.\", \"Love this place. For being a tap house, their food is just as amazing. The nachos are a must and the burgers a criteria. My favorite beer, hands down, the Sonoran White Chocolate. It even smells good. My kids ( yes, I take them) love their pulled pork sliders and chicken strips. And honestly, I don't blame them. Great place to hang out and just eat. While a tap houses isn't meant to be family friendly, Growler's gets it!\", 'This place is a diamond in the rough when it comes to appearance. The food is fantastic. Fresh. Seasoned superbly. Portioned and priced just right. If you want authentic this is right off the highway and down the road from VA and Costco. Again, you cannot go wrong. Enjoy. Bonus... fresh tamales.', 'A-mazingly delicious bone in ribeye. With grilled shrimp. Make your reservations NOW for Charro Steak & Del Rey. Everything else delicious too. But the steak took the prize. Also featured: ceviche and seafood enchiladas.', \"Having visited a few of the Phoenix locations, I was PUMPED for Postino to open in Tucson. Charcuterie is pretty much my life blood. Give me wine and cheese any day. I love their Butcher's Block and bruschetta boards. And I'll usually order a glass of bold red off their winelist, and I've never been mad about it.\\n\\nI hadn't been able to visit before coronavirus decided to show up and ruin everything. I saw Postino was offering a bruschetta and bottle special on Monday and Tuesday, so I called up for curbside. I ended up getting their date-night special, which was a snacky thing, bruschetta board, and salad for $25. The guy on the phone was super nice and let me know all their bottles of wine were $15 each. Wine not? He said they had just changed their wine program and didn't have the Centenario cab I wanted, but they had a new one that was really great. This feast cost me $43, including tax. Ordinarily, that would have been $80. And all I had to do was drive there and pull my car up front.\\n\\nThe food was all great. I was super pleased with their service as well. I wanted to give a good tip for how hard their staff is working, and the young lady who brought my order asked if she could include my tip as a donation for their #TakeoutForTeams program. All tip money is going to employees who aren't able to come in to work right now. I thought that was very heartwarming.\", 'Moved to Tucson about two years ago. First restaurant I visited was Prep & Pastry.  It was in a very charming non-fancy building.  The food and service was outstanding.  The coffee even better. \\nI have been a regular since and always take guests and family who are in town to P&P.  They are now in a new building.\\n Still great', \"This place is absolutely underrated. It deserves higher rating. Been here a couple times and every visit was amazing. Friendly service. Clean bathroom. Affordable food. They also have BBQ and sushi other than buffet. Disappointed with this lockdown as I can't get their food when I want. Will come back once they reopen\", \"I always enjoy my food, and the staff is really friendly and fun! They have it set up to move people through quickly so it's great on the go. Fully stocked bar if you want to hang out too.\", \"I am honestly impressed at the food choices offered, the alcohol offered, and the amazing weight stuff especially during this time. I would honestly take a bottle of their nacho cheese home that go with the pretzels. If you haven't tried it already I would honestly try their blonde beer. This place doesn't disappoint. The prices are amazingly low and support local. \\n\\nIf you want to book a large party (20 or more people) they have a private back room with a really nice atmosphere and tables.\", \"The NW side is sorely lacking in good taco shops. This might be the best. The food is great - authentic street tacos and burritos. The people complaining on Yelp about the price must be used to Nico's/Berto's food and prices. This is a different style of food for sure. It's more like El Guero or Aqui Con El Nene. Good food, but at slightly higher prices.\", 'Love love love...... we played hooky from work today and had an amazing time.  The wine is amazing.... The food is amazing..... and the staff is amazing.  We had the cheese board, the nine iron sandwich and the prosciutto and when I say EVERYTHING was sooooo good.  We will definitely be back.', \"This is honestly my all-time favorite restaurant in Tucson! I really mean this. I've been trying so hard to find authentic Asian food, especially Taiwanese or Cantonese cuisine. I'm so incredibly happy that this restaurant has opened here in town. Literally everything I have tried here has been amazing. From the chicken bites, roast duck rice, BBQ pork rice with egg, to all of their drinks. Their pork rib soup is so delicious and satisfying! Even their Hong Kong style lemon tea is absolutely divine. It is exactly what I've been searching for in Tucson. \\n\\nOn top of this, their service exceeds all expectations every time I've gone. This seems like a place that takes care of their employees and it shows based on the high quality of service. I've been here probably 5 times now, and every time I leave full of food and happiness.  I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ENOUGH. PLEASE COME HERE.\", \"Excellent food.  Everything was fresh and well cooked. I'm a great believer in doing a few good things with excellence rather than trying g to be all things to all people. This menu reflects that. I had the chilaquiles devorciados and they were very very good. The salsa roja is spicy and I could have licked it off the plate. Don't forget to try one of the aguas -- I had the pepino.  I could have drank a gallon of that good stuff. \\nWe will certainly go back -- and it's wonderful to find a downtown restaurant that is open on Sundays!  I encourage all of you to go and support this new local place.\", 'I love this place they are so hospitable and you can tell they cool their food with love! thank you so much', 'We love eating here.  If we lived in Tucson I would eat here several times a week.  We usually try for once a week or so when possible.  My mom loves their Duck Confet hash and I always have several favorite I switch off.  When we come on the weekend I have to have the Chicken and Toast.  Awesome food and drinks.', \"We're driving across the country back home -- California to Tennessee and now Tennessee to California , two dogs in the car (great both ways and sleep 97% of the time thankfully) and had one final stop before our stretch home. Needed a place to stop for breakfast with our dogs and we are so beyond thrilled we came across raptor canyon cafe. We stopped around 11am on a Tuesday morning during covid in December so you never know what'll be open, and it's by far the most incredibly comforting and delicious spot imaginable. My fiancé had the southwestern burrito, hash cake, and we split a waffle stick order of three. I went basic with the avocado toast and added a fried egg. Both came with green apple slices. I also had a coffee and the sweet owner included his wife's favorite vanilla creamer that I loved. Also, I read reviews on the home made chocolate cookies by none other than the wonderful wife-- and they. Were. So. Great. Physically restraining myself from eating every bit of those cookies immediately. \\n\\nI would consider myself a picky person, my fiancé would eat nearly anything-- and we both agreed that the food was not only delicious, affordable, unique, and comforting-- but the service and the family were truly one of a kind. I am so happy we had the pleasure to meet them and support the wonderful business they've built while enjoying the insanely yummy food.\\n\\nWe will absolutely be back even if it means coming 8 hours from home :)\", \"Always loved Freddy's when I went to Texas and was glad to see they have them in Arizona. This one prepared the best testing food and took pride in appearance. Will definitely go back the next time I'm out that way.\", 'We were unexpectedly staying at a nearby hotel and decided to try Charro Steak out. \\nWe sat at the bar and Cody was the bartender that night. He was awesome!\\nHe gave great service and also had some great suggestions for our meal. We split a t-bone. It was a little chewy but was cooked perfectly and had a great taste. I would get a different cut next time. \\nThe scallop type potatoes were eye-rolling delicious. We had mini-chimis for an appetizer and they were the best I have ever eaten. Everything was freshly made, no pre-frozen food here. All the employees were extremely nice and helpful. Loved this restaurant!', 'Amazing customer service! Everyone here was so friendly and the food was phenomenal! Will definitely be coming back to try their other dishes :)', 'Our server Kristi was absolutely amazing.

Check out the birria aka \"beeria\" tacos on taco Tuesday @ 2/$5   You will not be disappointed.', \"Ghini's is always the best. I go there mostly for the bread and patisseries. It is best to go early because everything sells out! However, whenever I sit down for a full meal, the service is quick and the food is great. Love it!\", 'I absolutely love this hidden gem. The outdoor seating has fantastic views of the mountains and shaded or sunny seating. The Kurdish tea served on a beautiful tea set cannot be found anywhere else. Homemade desserts are delicious as well. Every once in awhile a traditional Kurdish dish will appear on the menu. The omelets and pancakes are excellent for breakfast. Plenty of usual American food options as well as unique offerings.', \"Hands down the most authentic Chinese food you'll get in all of Tucson. It's amazing and definitely super filling and great prices. They are very welcoming and accommodating. They have so many items that you just can't get anywhere else\", \"Haven't posted in a while.  My wife and I came here for brunch today. We kept saying we gotta go every time we pass by.  \\nSide note.. for those who don't know in 2016 they participated in the 2016 World Margarita Championship in Tucson  and recieved 1st place for their Raspberry Rose Margarita in the People's Choice Category. \\nSo back to the food. We ordered Chicken Florentine crepe and a Croque Madame. Everything was perfect from the bechamel sauce to the hash browns. Good coffee too. Everything was on point. We took notice of all the food coming out of the kitchen and it all look tasty. Unfortunately this time i didnt take a picture of our meals but they were great. The staff was awesome. The portions weren't overwhelming. We plan on going back and trying different items and maybe doing dinner this month.  If you want try French cuisine give them a try.\", \"I didn't know that I could fall in love with food, but then I met Charro Steak and Del Rey! The moment you walked into either one of the connected restaurants, you notice the love that went into the environment. It is welcoming and inviting. So inviting we continue to come back. The team at Si Charro makes you feel at home, and they are all so gracious. I definitely appreciate it when the manager or Chef comes by and ensures that you have a good experience. \\n\\nMy favorite dishes here are the Lobster Tamalada, Surf & turf Enchiladas Banderas, and The Filet for steaks. Just about anything that you order will be a splendid experience for your palate. They also provide some incredible take-home meals for the holidays that are divine and easy to prepare.\\n\\nThe atmosphere and food is so fantastic that we hosted (pre-covid) our entire wedding party for our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding. They definitely made that night a memorable one. One that I am forever grateful for. Their hospitality and service. Top-notch! \\n\\nYou won't be disappointed if you're on the hunt for a steakhouse or looking to catch some tasty seafood.  \\n\\nDuring the times of Covid-19, Si Charro restaurants have gone above and beyond to keep their customers safe. They have rolled out a 100 point plan that you can access on their website for more (and I mean MORE) details on what it is exactly they are doing for us, the customers. They provide curb-side take-out that and you can easily pull upright and front and have your food brought out to the car. \\n\\nWe are life long customers!!\", 'Started working in the \"field\" as they say\\nAnd I have to use a fleet gas card, on a pretty tight schedule, I don\\'t have time for anybody\\'s crap. At Quiktrip, they understand the fleet card system, they have food (spicy jalapeño & cheese dog, is super good... who knew.. gas station lunch... don\\'t get the sushi, not that I did but no one should get sushi at a gas station even if it is a quicktrip) The people working at this particular Quiktrip were very good, polite, followed Covid Stuff, and had a sense of humor. They all deserve raises!!!', \"Went here for breakfast right before leaving Tucson, and it was amazing. The food was great and service was awesome. I got the horchata, which was made from scratch, and also got the omelette with the Oaxacan cheese. If I'm ever In town again I'll definitely be stopping by for a bite to eat.

Thank you Macy!!', 'I very highly recommend this restaurant . The food was great the wine was great but what makes it stand head and shoulders above any place I have been to is the exceptional service.

It was an amazing experience, they are so nice there and loved the atmosphere. Thank you!!!!!', \"So yummy and the staff is very friendly! The reviews drew me in, and the food would draw me back again. The medium salsa has a depth in the flavor unlike I've ever had. The fish burrito, outstanding!!

Restaurants all around town, take notice!\", \"I ordered from them the first time right after they first opened and didn't even have an online listing - Door Dash recommended them. I loved them so much, I went on Facebook and raved about them. I have ordered from them numerous times, and every time, the food has been delicious. I also like that there are so many different items that aren't all the same as other restaurants. I highly recommend them. :)\", 'Absolutely stunning decor, great service and wonderful food.

My mom and I are new to Tucson, AZ and we live near here and decided to try it! Highly recommend! Great food and great service!', \"I loved this so much that I've had the same order 3 times in the last few weeks. The last order (for pick-up) was missing all of the meat in the Butcher's Block. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until I had already made it home. My boyfriend and I decided to give them a call, to double check that we had the correct board and to let them know it was lacking some ingredients. The person we spoke to was apologetic, and not only replaced the entire board properly made, but delivered it to our house! Incredible service, as always. And the food was amazing!\", 'Just happened upon this place traveling through across Arizona. Glad we stopped, attentive service, size able portions, decent pricing.

That's 5 til 5 is everything drink up\", 'This is one of the best wine bars I have been to. Today was my first time coming here since they had just opened up recently. The service was beyond amazing. The staff was very helpful and had a lot of knowledge. The atmosphere was light. The food came out in really good time even with them being busy. The bruschetta plate with a combination of choices was amazing. The goat cheese meatballs were delicious. The wine was also outstanding! I am definitely coming back!', 'Well now is now the food that has everybody on spcial media growing crazy, right next to tacos. Raijin has the most amazing authentic ramen I have had in Arizona yet, hands down! Be sure to get it extra spicy if you are feeling brave, especially with ths pork broth!', 'Village bakehouse is the best in my belief and caters to your every need. I told them that I wanted my birthday cake and they asked me what I wanted down it and inside it and told them  To the delicious raspberry filling along with the butter cream frosting over the white cake. I also told them to surprise me with the ocean scene with waves and the Sun and this is what they happily surprised me with. I love it and is super moist and tastes delicious. I wish I could have told them on this spot when I picked up my cake but  At least gave them a tip. Thank you so much for being open on my birthday this year and all the other years in the past! I would highly recommend everyone trying something there because all of their food is delicious but seriously have not had much breakfast  or lunch there. I just love my sweets and even their day old stuff is really tasty that is discounted.', 'This place is very nice to eat dinner once in a while. The interior is good and comfortable to hangout. It is always crowded; therefore, I always feel in a hurry to finish my food. I have been here several times. Probably one of the best ramen places in Tucson. The soup is slightly saltier than I would expect. The service is very good. Do not be surprised if you see long line. The queue goes faster than I expect. \\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nThe soup was not salty this time. I ordered their limited time special, mapo tantanmen regular. If you are not spice tolerant, black roasted garlic tonkatsu and mapo regular would be the perfect choices. Trust me', \"This place never disappoints. Food is great, portions are generous.

I felt the value was definitely there.\", \"We had dinner here tonight and WOW! Chinese food done right!!! \\nHonestly speaking, for me the acid test is dumplings. So we decided to start with them. They come in chicken or pork varieties, and can be either steamed or fried. We went with fried pork, And they came out fragrant from the kitchen on a charming fish platter, with a small bowl of dipping sauce. We each grabbed one with our chopsticks and dug in---they were perfect!! Light and airy with a moist, mildly seasoned pork filling. We inhaled them!!!!\\nThen it was just a question of what other dishes we should try since it was our first time at 81 Hong Kong Café; We opted for bacon cabbage, which was delightfully prepared the cabbage still crisp and the bacon and red peppers sizzling... and chicken lettuce wraps which were savory and sweet.\\nTables are nicely spread out, and the New York City mural even had Kiehl's pharmacy on it!!!

Awesome sauce with it, we finished every single morsel on the plate. \\n\\nThen we had some drinks, they only serve beer and wine here - which makes you try some new things, but each drink we had was delicious and reasonably priced\\n\\nFor our entrees, we both tried a panini. I had the vegetarian, my wife had one with chicken and bacon - and they were perfect.\\n\\nOverall ambiance was awesome for a couple looking for a great dinner and date. We will definitely be back! Great addition to tucson\", \"Rosati's Pub had me addicted. I kept ordering The Chef like several days in a row. I think their thin crust pizza is the best, but I did not have the Chicago deep dish. Everything I ate tasted fresh and....happily made. You can tell when someone takes pride in preparing your food. Excellent!\", 'Great place for ordering take out dinner for the family or yourself, as well as being a nice date place. I have eaten at Opas Grill a few times. The service is solid and the food delicious.  I recommend the Greek salad, gyro platter, falafel burger, and the lemon potatoes.', 'Delicious! Everything is great, but I especially enjoy their burger. At the Campbell location the outdoor seating is on Campbell so it can be noisy, but the food and service make up for it. Recommend!', \"I stopped in yesterday after a long spa day to grab a bite. Both employees that helped me were extremely nice. The female employee recommended a berry tea with fresh orange slices that was pretty yummy and since I was heading back to my family I needed a little caffeine kick too so I got a small hot coffee. She recommended I try their delicious churro flavored coffee of the day! The coffee was perfectly smooth and not too sweet. Surprisingly it didn't taste artificial- I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but this was delicious. I downed it on the drive before even getting home and regretted not getting a bigger size. I grabbed a cold grilled chicken breast and a 1/2 lb of their cold orzo pasta salad to enjoy once I got home. The gentleman that helped me with the food said he didn't believe they seasoned either of their grilled salmon or chicken- I opted for chicken in case I needed to dip it into bbq or something- unseasoned or under salted salmon is a nightmare in my opinion- he was sweet and said they had salt and pepper packets to which I laughed and said no thanks- he understood. Haha so I got home and started sipping on the yummy iced tea and heated up my chicken breast which to my surprise WAS seasoned and very flavorful!! The orzo was also yummy! I was able to pick up some baked goods for my boys as well. Including a vegan and gluten free cookie for my kiddo with food allergies, a pleasant surprise! They also get you in and out of there asap which is so freaking nice. It's also kept very clean! At other grocery stores they are always understaffed and almost never offer to charge you out at the deli counter- NOT HERE! They are fast and efficient and extremely friendly! I'll be back when in the area for sure! It's definitely in a ritzy side of town inside of the la encantada mall so the prices match. For the customer service you receive and the amount of options they have it's worth the price. Unfortunately my boys inhaled their baked goods so I didn't snap a pic but I will share a pic of the chicken and orzo salad. From the bakery we got a chocolate cupcake, large cannoli and a vegan gf snickerdoodle cookie AND a slice of the most delicious lemon creme cake for me!  I recommend them for a quick meal or sweet treat- drink on the go when in the area!\", \"Great food and drinks, also amazing service Winter is the best server ever she was very nice and always there if I needed anything! \\nWould I return? I'm thinking yes...\", 'Great food, amazing potatoes! Super service!!! Wish there was one in Boise!!! We will definitely be back!', \"This is my to go spot for some good Mexican food. I usually get their enchilada combination plates which are bomb but, I've also tried their chimichanga, burritos, carna asada fries and their bomb ass breakfast burritos. Very good food and always great service!\", \"Eight of our networking group met at Ghini's to enjoy an informal lunch. We called to ask if they could accommodate our group. They have safety procedures, and distancing  for indoors and out. The staff was very professional, welcoming and attentive. The menu is varied and everyone commented on the excellent, delicious food. I am planning to go back for more of their coffee - many choices iced or hot! And a stop in the bakery for a treat to take home is a must!

Look out Arizona, this place is gonna blow up! I've lived in Arizona for over ten years now and this gem of a restaurant is hands down the BEST Sonoran Mexican joint I've been to.

The restaurant is clean, well laid out, and there is easily accesible parking in the rear. COVID precautions are taken seriously here but you will barely feel their impact. You will not be disappointed!\", \"My wife and I try many different Mexican restaurants in Arizona and agreed this is one of the best. Their signature beef dish is amazing, good service, the rellenos are some of the best I've had. I had the seafood rellenos this time and it will be tough to get anything else when we go again.

We were in Tucson on our way back from Mayo to El Paso and stopped for lunch. I was concerned it would be busy based on the parking lot but they found s us a nice outdoor place immediately. Service was very fast and friendly. I had the beer pretzels and hipster beer - both amazing! Only could ask for cheese to dip the pretzel in by that's just because I'm a a fat ass - the spicy mustard was great. Husband had carne asada quesadilla and loved them.

A must visit, the ambiance is lovely and authentic  I do not review but when I do It was earned.', \"Great food! Hot and Sour soup is great! Drinks options were abundant.  The black sweet lemon tea was very sweet and nice and bold (like grandma's sun tea).  The restaurant was clean, and tables are spaced apart. There is bar area seating, clean restrooms and they can accommodate larger groups.  I would personally prefer for some tofu in my hot and sour soup, but their soup was very tasty and delicious. The Kung Pao chicken was also great, i would prefer more peanuts and less onion though.  The beef and broccoli was well liked by my lunch date and i tried the broccoli and it was very delicious and crunchy fresh.  I look forward to trying more dishes and beverages here!\", 'Been there a few times not.  Good food and salsa.

THANK YOU for coming to Tucson!!\", 'First off, it made me chuckle when I opened the door to enter the restaurant and the gentleman at the door greeted me with \"welcome to la chingada.\" Mexican Spanish speakers find it a kick. The food was delicious and the beverages are pretty good. I found the agua de sandía to be a little underwhelming, but in all fairness, it\\'s not watermelon season.

I love places where you get amazing quality but don't have to pay for the frills, which is exactly what you get here. I had the chicken sliders w/ fries. I'm a fry snob and these were on point. The chicken sliders had an original flavor combo of coleslaw, honey mustard, and pineapple on a Hawaiian roll. It was the perfect combo of sweet and tangy. The chicken was breaded and fried just the way I like it (& didn't have any of that chewy sinew which you run into at a lot of places). We had our food delivered to the back bar which they just opened yesterday. Cold beer (they had my fave, Pizza Port Chronic Amber) & awesome service w/ a laid back artsy atmosphere.

I got my usual Red Tonkatsu with a side of extra pork, whereas my fiancé couldn't decide between getting ramen or trying out their yakisoba. Cesar was our server, very attentive and helpful. He suggested the Pork Yakisoba and we're so glad he did! I knew the ramen was good, but man I might actually get their Yakisoba next time! Lots of noodles, seasoned to perfection. They didn't skimp on the pork either! The spicy sauce on the side wasn't too spicy when added and gave the dish a blackened/smokey taste. We also got their Takoyaki balls as a side and those were also delicious.\\n\\nWe've also done their takeout service and it was a wonderful experience. Ordered in person and they bring it out to your car! The noodles and soup were separated to prevent soggy noodles. A great touch!
