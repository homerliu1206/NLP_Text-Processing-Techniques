## Nature Language Programming Project

### Problem Description
Understanding customer preferences and sentiments towards restaurants is crucial for business success. In this project, we aim to analyze Yelp reviews to uncover key factors influencing customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. By employing various natural language processing techniques, we seek to explore the relationship between textual information and star ratings, shedding light on the underlying reasons driving positive and negative customer experiences.

### Objectives
- Conduct sentiment analysis to discern the overall sentiment expressed in Yelp reviews.
- Utilize topic modeling to identify recurring themes and topics within the reviews.
- Employ classification methods to distinguish between reviews with high (5-star) and low (1-star) ratings.
- Extract actionable insights regarding the factors contributing to positive and negative customer feedback.

### Importance of the Project
The findings of this project will provide invaluable insights for restaurant owners and managers. By discerning the factors that customers value the most and those that lead to dissatisfaction, businesses can tailor their services and offerings to better meet customer expectations, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moreover, the project will contribute to the advancement of natural language processing techniques and their application in understanding consumer behavior.
